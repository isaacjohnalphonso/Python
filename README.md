This is my first try or attempt to learn code and using the Github.
My aim is to learn the python and wants others to know that I am learning and progressing.
Additionally, I do not know anything about Github and how it works, I hope that I come to know as I'm progressing.
Adding to that I want to make my progression to be noted down in public forum.
This page is specifically for the solutions or exercises that I am going to make from the book Python crash courses 3rd Edition.
